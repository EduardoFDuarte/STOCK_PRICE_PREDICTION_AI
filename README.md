# STOCK PRICE PREDICTION AI

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting stock prices using Artificial Intelligence techniques. It leverages deep learning models to forecast stock market trends based on historical stock data.

## Features

* **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Automated fetching and processing of stock data.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Insightful visualizations to understand stock data trends.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Implementation of advanced neural network architectures for accurate predictions.
* **Model Evaluation:** Comprehensive evaluation using metrics like MAE, MSE, and RMSE.

## Libraries Used

* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
* `scikit-learn`
* `tensorflow`
* `keras`

## Installation
